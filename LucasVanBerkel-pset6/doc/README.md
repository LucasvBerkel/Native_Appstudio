### Description:
I can hear you think, another movie searcher, did we not do that in week 3. That is true, but this app is completely new.
The only thing it has in common is the concept of it(and okay, really small tiny pieces of code).
The API used is a different one, which enables us not to only search movies, but also to search for tv-series and persons.
The layout of the list is because of this additional feature also reinvented, it is expandable listview,
which gives a nice view if the user is only interested in the persons he searched for.

The only I have to say: Check it out!

PS: little side note to be critical of myself. The only feature of the app I am not happy about, is that the favorites of a user
are stored locally. A good improvement of the app would be to migrate this database to firebase, but not enough time was left
to construct this. However, this feature was kept in mind when separating the concerns in classes.
